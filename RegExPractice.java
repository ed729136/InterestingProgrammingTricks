 * Was looking for a program to do and stumbled upon a website with multiple ideas

 * 
 * Count Vowels â€“ Enter a string and the program counts the number of vowels in the text. For 
 * added complexity have it report a sum of each vowel found. Solved this problem solving regular expressions.
 * Regular expressions are used as a way to validate data.
